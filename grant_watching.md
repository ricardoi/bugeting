# CSP Functional Genomics
## Joint Genome Institute
The CSP Functional Genomics call is to enable users to perform state-of-the-art functional genomics research and to help them translate genomic information into biological function. The emphasis is on projects leveraging JGI’s DNA synthesis and ‘omics capabilities to enhance understanding of gene and genome function, particularly those not readily achievable without the capabilities and expertise available at the JGI.

Proposals to this call may be submitted to the JGI at any time using a simple web-based form (begin a new proposal document at proposals.jgi.doe.gov to see the proposal format) and are reviewed twice a year. All proposals will undergo an internal pre-review to ensure technical feasibility and alignment with JGI and DOE missions. Screened proposals will be reviewed for scientific merit, DOE relevance, feasibility and impact.  Applicants are encouraged to review the Synthetic Biology Internal Review Process guidelines, as insufficient information will delay or potentially defer approval for the proposal.

For questions about whether your project is appropriate, or for program specifics or technical guidance, please contact Yasuo Yoshikuni (DNA synthesis program head), Trent Northen (metabolomics group lead), Tanja Woyke, Deputy for User Programs, or Miranda Harmon-Smith (project manager).  For questions about the application process, please contact Miranda Harmon-Smith.

Watch the  JGI Engagement: Accessing Functional Genomics Capabilities Webinar hosted by the DNA Synthesis Science group. The webinar invites researchers to submit white papers to the Community Science Program’s Functional Genomics call for proposals.
